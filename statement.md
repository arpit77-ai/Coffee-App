* Students practicing console applications
* Small café prototypes or demo systems
* Anyone wanting a simple order-simulation program


## High-Level Features

* View a menu of coffee items
* Add items to an order
* View all items in the current order
* Automatic total price calculation
* Checkout confirmation
* Clean, interactive console UI
