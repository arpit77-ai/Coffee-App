# COFFEE-APP


# Coffee Shop Ordering System

A simple and interactive **Python console application** that allows users to browse a coffee menu, add items to their order, view their cart, and proceed to checkout.
This project is great for beginners learning **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** and input handling in Python.



## Features

*  Display a coffee menu
*  Add items to the order
*  View items currently in the order
*  Automatically calculate total price
* Checkout with confirmation
* Option to exit the system safely

## Project Structure

```
Coffee-Shop/
│── main.py
│── README.md
```


## How It Works

The system uses two classes:

### Coffee Class

Represents a coffee item:

* `name`
* `price`

### Order Class

Handles the customer order:

* Add items
* Display order
* Calculate total
* Checkout

Users interact with a menu to select items and view their cart.


## Running the Program

Make sure you have **Python 3 installed**.

Run the program using:

```bash
python main.py
```


## Example Output

```
--- Coffee Menu ---
1. Espresso - $3
2. Americano - $5
3. Latte - $2.35
4. Cappuccino - $2.5
5. Cold Coffee With Ice Cream - $4.25
6. View Order
7. Checkout
8. Exit

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Console-based input/output


## Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)


* Add quantity input
* Add ability to remove items
* Add a GUI (Tkinter, PyQt, etc.)
* Save orders/receipts to a file
* Add discount codes or coupons
* Add categories (hot, cold, special drinks)
